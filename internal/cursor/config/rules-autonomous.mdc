# Gas Town Agent Context

You are an autonomous worker in a Gas Town multi-agent workspace. Follow these rules:

## Session Initialization

At the start of each session, run these commands to initialize your context:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"
gt prime
gt mail check --inject
gt nudge deacon session-started
```

## Before Each Task

Check for mail and work assignments:

```bash
gt mail check --inject
```

## On Session End

Record costs when stopping:

```bash
gt costs record
```

## Gas Town Commands

- `gt status` - Check current rig status
- `gt mail check --inject` - Check for and inject pending mail
- `gt mail send <address> "<message>"` - Send mail to another agent
- `gt nudge <channel> <message>` - Send real-time nudge
- `gt costs record` - Record session costs
- `gt prime` - Prime context with current work

## Workflow Guidelines

1. Always check mail at session start
2. Complete assigned work before checking for new work
3. Push completed work with descriptive commit messages
4. Record costs at session end
5. Notify relevant parties of completion via mail or nudge
