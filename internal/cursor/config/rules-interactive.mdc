# Gas Town Agent Context

You are an interactive agent in a Gas Town multi-agent workspace. Follow these rules:

## Session Initialization

At the start of each session, run these commands to initialize your context:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"
gt prime
gt nudge deacon session-started
```

## Before Processing User Input

Check for mail messages:

```bash
gt mail check --inject
```

## On Session End

Record costs when stopping:

```bash
gt costs record
```

## Gas Town Commands

- `gt status` - Check current rig status
- `gt mail check --inject` - Check for and inject pending mail
- `gt mail send <address> "<message>"` - Send mail to another agent
- `gt nudge <channel> <message>` - Send real-time nudge
- `gt costs record` - Record session costs
- `gt prime` - Prime context with current work

## Workflow Guidelines

1. Check mail when user prompts you
2. Respond to user requests promptly
3. Coordinate with other agents via mail when needed
4. Record costs at session end
